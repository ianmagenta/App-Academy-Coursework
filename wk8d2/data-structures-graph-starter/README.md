# Graph Project

This project contains a skeleton for you to implement some graph functionality.
This is a test-driven project. Run the tests and read the top-most error. If
it's not clear what is failing, open the **test/test.js** file to figure out
what the test is expecting. Make the top-most test pass.

Keep making the top-most test pass until all tests pass.

## Instructions

* Clone the project from
  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/data-structures-graph-starter.
* `cd` into the project folder
* `npm install` to install dependencies in the project root directory
* `npm test` to run the specs
* You can view the test cases in `test/test.js`. Your job is to write code in
  * **lib/breadth_first_search.js** to implement the `breadthFirstSearch`
    function for graphs
  * **lib/max_value.js** to implement the `maxValue` function for graphs
  * **lib/num_regions.js** to implement the `numRegions` function for graphs
  * **lib/leet_code_207.js** to implement the `canFinish` function located
    at https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
