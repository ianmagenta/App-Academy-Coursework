# Heaps Project

This project contains a skeleton for you to implement a max heap. This is a
test-driven project. Run the tests and read the top-most error. If it's not
clear what is failing, open the **test/test.js** file to figure out what the
test is expecting. Make the top-most test pass.

Keep making the top-most test pass until all tests pass.

## Instructions

* Clone the project from
  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/data-structures-max-heap-starter.
* `cd` into the project folder
* `npm install` to install dependencies in the project root directory
* `npm test` to run the specs
* You can view the test cases in `test/test.js`. Your job is to write code in
  * **lib/max_heap.js** to implement the `MaxHeap` class
  * **lib/is_heap.js** to implement the `isMaxHeap` function
  * **lib/leet_code_215.js** to implement the `findKthLargest` function located
    at https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/
