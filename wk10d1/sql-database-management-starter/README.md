# Database Management Project

This project asks you to write some SQL to make some tests pass. You must do
them in order of the file name.

You'll be writing your SQL in *.sql files. This is just like writing it in the
`psql` client. You put semicolons after each statement. But, you don't have to
worry about silly mistakes because it's in a file and they're easy to fix.

## Instructions

* Clone the project from
  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/sql-database-management-starter.
* `cd` into the project folder
* `npm install` to install dependencies in the project root directory
* `npm test` to run the specs
* You can view the test cases in `test`. Your job is to write code in
  * **01-create-users.sql** to write statements that will create users
  * **01-create-databases.sql** to write statements that will create databases
  * **01-create-aa-times-tables.sql** will create related tables in a database
